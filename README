Description:
The code profiler is meant to be used to time functions or operations
at runtime with the best possible precision. It uses high precision
timers for both Windows and Linux to provide time profiles for any
statement.

Notes:
The output times should be considered relative to each other. The
absolute values of the runtimes may be affected by the OS command
process timer which may add some constant time to your profile.
